        Optional API version to use.  If unset, version 12 will be used (the default API version of the Rundeck
        client used by Jenkins Rundeck plugin). If you are connecting to an older version of Rundeck, you may have
        to set this to an earlier API version such as "9" for example.<br>
        Refer to the <a href="http://rundeck.org/docs/api/">Rundeck API Reference documentation</a> for more info.

  This plugin is a Notifier (Publisher) that will talk to a <a href="http://www.rundeck.org">Rundeck</a> instance
  (via its HTTP API) to schedule a job execution on Rundeck after a successful build on Jenkins.<br />
  It is also a Jenkins Trigger, that will schedule a build on Jenkins after a job execution on Rundeck (using Rundeck WebHook Notification).<br />
  In addition, it turns Jenkins into an <a href="http://rundeck.org/docs/manual/jobs.html#option-model-provider">Option provider</a>
  for Rundeck, if you want to use your Jenkins build artifacts as an option to a Rundeck job.

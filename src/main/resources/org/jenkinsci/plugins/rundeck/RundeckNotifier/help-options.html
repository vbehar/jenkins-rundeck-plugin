    <p>
        This is the list of options for the Rundeck job you want to execute.
        It should be in the Java-Properties format, 1 option per line : <strong>key=value</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use Jenkins environment variables ($BUILD_NUMBER, $BUILD_ID, $JOB_NAME, $WORKSPACE, etc) or System environment variables ($HOME, $PATH, etc) in your options, 
        and we will expand them when notifying Rundeck.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will also expand the special token "$ARTIFACT_NAME{regex}" (where "regex" is a java-regex) to the name of the first matching artifact found.<br>
        For example, $ARTIFACT_NAME{.*\.war} will matches your WAR artifact, while $ARTIFACT_NAME{.*-sources\.jar} will matches your sources artifact.

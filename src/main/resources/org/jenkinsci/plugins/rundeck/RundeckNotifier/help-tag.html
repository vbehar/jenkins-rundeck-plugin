<div>
    Used to perform "on-demand" job scheduling on Rundeck: if the value is not empty,
    we will check if the SCM changelog contains any one of the given comma-separated tag(s),
    and only schedule a job execution if it is present. For example you can set the value to
    "<strong>#deploy</strong>" or "<strong>#deploy,#redeploy</strong>". Note that if this value
    is left empty, we will ALWAYS schedule a job execution.
